      - You can Share the comics you're looking at with ONLY your BEEEEST friend

   Features that are being looked into:

   - A pretty printed Explanation that gets rid of the links and whatnot used by Wikipedia to format their texts
   - Zoom-in

    4. Browse!!
    
   * Acessing Features: 
   - Search: Search appears in top right corner of the app, in the toolbar, tap it, and type the number of the comic you want to look at (Don't type 404 - Trust me, it's empty)
   - Explanation: To access the explanation, all you have to do is tap the far left button in the footer (Well, not really a footer, but it's on the bottom) of the application
   - Favorite a Comic: Right next to the explanation, to the right, there is a Star icon button that when you tap, magic happens This Button adds the currently shown comic to your favorites list
   - Favorite Gallery: Right next to the star sits a gallery button that allows you to view your favorite comics, it even works while you're offline! How cool is that?!
   - Last but not least - Share: To share the comic you're currently viewing, just tap the share icon that is the last in the array   of icons! It will take you to the screen where you can pick your best friend to share the comic with!
      
### Known Issues
   * There are some known issues that will be fixed in future updates:
   - If there is not explanation (i.e. comic JUST came out) on the wiki, you won't be able to add that comic to your favorites 
   - You can't yet zoom-in on the image, so some big images might appear unreadable and small, depends on your eyes
   - On Rotating the screen, the layout keeps its form, but the images become much bigger and they need scrolling down so that you can see whole thing
   - Gallery View currently Displays all the details of the comic, and it looks messy (Lots of scrolling)
   - You have to scroll to the bottom of the page to access the controls (Explanation, Fav, Gallery, Share)
